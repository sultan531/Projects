# 🎵 AcouDiagnose – Early Risk Detection Device

This project falls under Aviation Safety and Security, focusing on using sound frequencies as an early indicator of potential hazards. Certain technical faults, like air leaks or mechanical failures, often produce unusual sounds that go unnoticed, increasing accident risk.

## 💡 Innovative Solution
AcouDiagnose is a smart device installed in airplanes, airports, cargo rooms, and other environments. It continuously analyzes surrounding acoustic signals, and when unusual frequencies are detected, it triggers an early alert using AI & ML models trained to recognize abnormal sounds.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Acoustic Signal Processing  
- Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning (AI & ML)  
- High-sensitivity Sound Sensors  

## 🌍 Expected Impact
- Reduce accidents caused by unnoticed technical faults.  
- Improve early response efficiency and preventive maintenance.  
- Enhance overall safety in aviation, cargo handling, buildings, and vehicles, while lowering operational costs.

## 📂 Contents
- Design schematics and diagrams of AcouDiagnose.  
- AI & ML model documentation.  
- Sensor specifications and technical notes.  

## 🎯 Goal
To showcase a practical, innovative solution for early hazard detection, combining mechanical, electrical, and AI-based engineering.
